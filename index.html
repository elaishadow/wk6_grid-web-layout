                    surpassing TV-Shows and Movies that we seen today in story telling, plot, and the sense of direction
                    of the story. My side hobby is to tinkering PCs and similar fields.

                    my budget with high expectation of performance. Back into my high
                    school days, I was modding a lot of Pokemon games and pu some twists into it. But as more things
                    consume my time, I could not have time to do it like I used to do.
